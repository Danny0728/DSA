# Grokking Algorithms in Go Repository

This repository contains implementations of algorithms in Go, based on the book "Grokking Algorithms" by `Aditya Bhargava`. The purpose of this repository is to provide clear and concise examples of various algorithms and data structures, helping learners understand fundamental concepts in computer science through practical coding examples.

## Introduction

This repository is a comprehensive collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in the Go programming language. Whether you're a beginner learning algorithms for the first time or an experienced developer looking to brush up on your skills, this repository aims to provide clear, concise, and well-commented implementations of various algorithms and data structures.

## What's Inside?
Inside this repository, you'll find implementations of a wide range of algorithms and data structures, including but not limited to:

Sorting algorithms (e.g., Quicksort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort) 
Search algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
<!--Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, )
Dynamic programming algorithms -->
And more!
Each algorithm is accompanied by detailed comments explaining its logic, time complexity analysis, and usage examples. Additionally, we strive to maintain a clean and idiomatic Go code, following best practices and standards.


## How to Execute 
for example if you want to run binaryTree implementation for preorder just type
```go run . --binaryTree=preorder```

for any other algo to run 
```go run . --selectionSort```
